# Platform engine for Labyrinth game

### Used an existing platform for developing the game.
Made a lot of code changes and restructures from the original code.
- Added new, more difficult map
- Restructured project structure
- Added death counter, to limit number of tries total
- Set up next level to change map if you complete one
- 3 maps, with increasing difficulty


## TODO:
- Add timer
- Add more maps
- Add checkpoints
